# Code Review and Debugging Examples

This repository demonstrates my ability to evaluate, analyze, and improve Python code
by identifying logical errors, inefficiencies, and clarity issues.

## Project Overview
I created and reviewed several Python scripts containing intentional bugs or design flaws.
For each example, I documented:
- The issue identified
- Why it impacts correctness or performance
- A corrected version of the code

## Skills Demonstrated
- Code comprehension and logic evaluation
- Debugging and refactoring
- Clear written technical feedback
- Attention to detail and consistency

## Tools Used
- Python
- Markdown documentation

This project reflects the type of structured code evaluation and feedback required
in software annotation and AI model training workflows.
